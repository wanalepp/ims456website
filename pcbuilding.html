<p class="margin1"> Ever since I was in high school, I took the interest in PC building. 
	I learned from Youtube on how to build a computer. I started my interest in pc building when I was 14 years old. I started my journey
	by upgrading my home computer. I bought a graphics card using my savings. Building a PC can be a very interesting and rewarding hobby 
	for many people. These are the few main reasons why I am interested in building a PC. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Firstly, building a PC allows me to fully customize my computer to my specific needs and preferences. 
	On the other hand, when building a PC, I can choose each individual component myself, ensuring that I will get exactly what I want 
	and need.
	<br>
	<br>
	Secondly, building a PC can also be a great way to save money. While it is true that buying a laptop can be more 
	convenient, it is often more expensive than building a PC myself. By purchasing each component separately and assembling the PC myself, 
	I can save quite a bit of money compared to buying a laptop. This is appealing to me because I am usually on a tight budget.
	<br>
	<br>
	Finally, building a PC can be a very enjoyable and educational experience. Assembling a PC requires me to learn 
	about different computer components and how they work together. This can be a great way to learn more about computers and technology 
	in general.
	<br>
	<br>
	Thus, building a PC can be a very interesting and a rewarding hobby. It allows for customization, 
	can save money, and can be a great learning experience.
