	tap on circles, sliders, and spinners in time with the beat of a song. The game has a large community of users who create their own 
	custom beatmaps for players to enjoy, and a ranking system that allows players to compete and earn points. osu! is popular in the 
	anime and gaming communities and can be played using a mouse, tablet, keyboard, or touchscreen.

	I have played osu ever since early high school. I have met all kinds of people in the community. Below you can watch my gameplay of
	the game.
