<p class="movie">
	An aging Chinese immigrant is swept up in an insane adventure, in which she alone can save the world by exploring other universes 
	connecting with the lives she could have led. With her laundromat teetering on the brink of failure and her marriage to wimpy husband 
	Waymond on the rocks, overworked Evelyn Wang struggles to cope with everything, including a tattered relationship with her judgmental 
	father Gong Gong and Joy, her daughter. And, as if facing a gloomy midlife crisis weren't enough, Evelyn must brace herself for an 
	unpleasant meeting with an impersonal bureaucrat: Deirdre, the shabbily dressed IRS auditor. However, as the stern agent loses patience, 
	an inexplicable multiverse rift becomes an eye-opening exploration of parallel realities. Will Evelyn jump down the rabbit hole? 
	How many stars are there in the universe? Can weary Evelyn fathom the irrepressible force of possibilities, tap into newfound powers, 
	and prevent an evil entity from destroying the thin, countless layers of the unseen world?
