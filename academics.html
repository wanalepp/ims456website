<p class="about"><a target="_blank" href="images/logo.png"><img class="imgone" src="images\logo.png"> </a>
	I studied in Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Jalan Tiga Bandar Baru Bangi from 2012 until 2016. When I was 16 (Form 4) I was in the 
	accounting and arabic class which I took 11 Subjects for my Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia. Out of the 11, I scored 5A's in total. 
	<br>
	<br>
	I had fond memories in this school as it builds my character and my passion for accounting. I had teachers who helped me realize 
	what my passion was and guided me with the path to become a successful accountant.

	I furthered my studies at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Perak, Tapah Branch. I took a Diploma in Accountancy 
	for about 2 and a half years. I started in June of 2017 and I finished my diploma in January of 2020. 
	In between those years, I have continued to pursue my passion in accounting. 
	In addition, I have met a lot of good friends while I was studying there.

	In 2020, I got the offer to continue my studies in Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Johor, Segamat Branch. 
	Unfortunately, I started my bachelor during the COVID-19 pandemic. This meant that we had to conduct our classes online. 
	This went on until the March of 2022 where we finally get to go to the campus to have physical classes. 
	This means that I only get to experience this campus for only a year before I graduate from my bachelor.
